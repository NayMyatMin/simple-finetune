Overconfidence: 7.0/10
Overall Reliability: 2.0/10
Hallucination Type: INTRINSIC
Hallucination Examples:
  1. Radcliffe Line
Analysis: The generated answer 'Radcliffe Line' is incorrect as it refers to a historical boundary established during the partition of India in 1947, while the current boundary between India and Bangladesh is referred to as the International Border (IB). This answer contradicts the provided ground truth and demonstrates a significant level of fabrication, leading to a high hallucination severity score.

Overall Reliability: 5.0/10
Hallucination Type: INTRINSIC
Hallucination Examples:
  1. 1997
Analysis: The generated answer '1997' contradicts the ground truth answer 'the 90s' by providing a specific year that is not universally accepted as the definitive end date for Jell-O pudding pops. While 1997 is a plausible date, it is not fully supported by the broader context of the product's discontinuation, which is generally referenced as occurring in the 90s. This indicates a level of overconfidence in the specific year provided.
